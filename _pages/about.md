Hi, I am Zhehao Dong. I am currently a master's student at the [College of Engineering](https://www.coe.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). In September 2024, I received my bachelor's degree in Software Engineering & Mechanics from [Sichuan University](https://www.scu.edu.cn/). During my academic journey, I gained practical experience as an NLP/Multimodal large language models algorithm intern at [Baidu AI Cloud](https://cloud.baidu.com/).

My research interests lie in **Large Language Model(LLM)**, **Natural Language Processing(NLP)**, and **AI agents**. 

You can find my r√©sum√© here: [Zhehao Dong's R√©sum√©](http://vittoriodong.github.io/zhehaodong.github.io/assets/resume.pdf).
