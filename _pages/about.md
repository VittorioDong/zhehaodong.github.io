Hi, I am Zhehao Dong. I am currently a master's student at the College of Engineering, Peking University. In September 2024, I earned my bachelor's degree in Software Engineering & Mechanics from Sichuan University. During my academic journey, I gained practical experience as an NLP/Multimodal Large Language Models algorithm intern at Baidu AI Cloud.

My research interests lie in **Large Language Model(LLM)**, **Natural Language Processing(NLP)**, and **AI agents**.
